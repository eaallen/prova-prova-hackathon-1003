# Prova Hackathon

This was my submission for a hackathon put on by Prova on May 17th, 2025.

My wife suggested I build SnapBuy, a rip off of snapChat where you do bidding in an auction via taking pictures instead of just talking to random peeps.

I used cursor to do the bulk of the programming, where I treated myself as a product manager instead of just a coder. I made sure to engage with the Cursor AI in the same way I would an actaul 
engineer:

* gave a brief overview of the project
* asked for feasabilty and next steps
* reviwed code and UI one page at a time.

It worked out supprisingly well. While the AI did not implment the backend the way I would have (infact there were some serious issues that I just ignored given the time crunch of the hackathon)
it did do a pretty good job at getting my POC up and running.
